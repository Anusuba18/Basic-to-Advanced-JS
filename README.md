Task 31: Even or Odd
"Write an if statement to determine whether a number is even or odd. Build logic from scratch!"

Task 32: Nested Conditions
"Use nested if statements to classify numbers as negative, positive, or zero. Handle all possibilities!"

Task 33: Ternary Operator
"Replace an if-else statement with a ternary operator. Simplify conditional logic in JavaScript!"

Task 34: Logical Operators
"Evaluate combinations of &&, ||, and !. Build powerful conditions using logical operators!"

Task 35: Functions
"Write functions with parameters and default values. Learn the basics of reusable code!"

Task 36: Arrow Functions
"Declare arrow functions for cleaner syntax. Explore the modern way of writing JavaScript functions!"
Task 37: Logical Operators in Range
